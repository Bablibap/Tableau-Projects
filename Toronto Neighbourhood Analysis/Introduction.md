## Introduction

Moving to Toronto either from another city or state within Canada, or from another country, it can be a daunting task selecting the best location to live either permanently or temporarily. 
Toronto has a population of approximately 2.7 million people living in 140 neighbourhoods. The purpose of this project is to provide people who are considering relocation, an idea of some of the best neighbourhoods in Toronto. 
This report also serves the purpose of providing neighbourhood profile information to future home owners/renters in Toronto.

The data on the neighbourhood profiles was taken from the Toronto Open Data website, which is a government maintained public data source.
The dataset was built on the 2016 census data collected by and maintained by the Canadian government. 
The dataset used for this project only contains data pertaining to residents of Toronto. 
This dataset contains extensive demographic information of the residents of Toronto, some of which include:
1.       Age 
2.       Gender 
3.       Relationships of household members 
4.       Knowledge of official languages 
5.       Other languages spoken 
6.       First language 
7.       Sociocultural information 
8.       Education 
9.       Household Income 
10.      Housing 
To explore and derive insights of the neighbourhoods best suited for future home owners or renters, the following variables were considered: 
1.       Age 
2.       Marital Status 
3.       Household Income 
4.       Housing Type 
5.       Ownership Type 
  
These five factors are some of the most important factors that influence oneâ€™s decision in shortlisting a neighbourhood for their next home. 
This will provide a comprehensive guide for users to quickly go through each neighbourhood and determine the popular neighbourhoods based on the factors stated above.
